# 🌌 NeuralCanvas: Visual AI Orchestration Studio

## 👁️ Vision
To create the ultimate visual workspace where users can compose, orchestrate, and watch complex AI workflows involving multiple LLMs (via OpenRouter) as if they were conductors of a digital symphony.

Unlike traditional chat interfaces, NeuralCanvas treats AI interactions as **nodes in a living graph**. It combines the drag-and-drop simplicity of **n8n** with the raw cognitive power of a multi-agent system.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy
1.  **Visual First:** Every logic, every connection, every thought process must be visible on the infinite canvas. No hidden back-end magic; if an agent talks to another, you see the line glow.
2.  **Hybrid Control:** 
    *   **Manual Mode:** The user explicitly wires "GPT-4 Node" to "Claude Node".
    *   **Auto Mode:** A "Coordinator Node" dynamically spawns and connects temporary worker nodes based on the query complexity.
3.  **Futuristic Aesthetics:** The UI should feel like a sci-fi command center (Minority Report / Iron Man style). Glassmorphism, neon accents, smooth animations.
4.  **Radical Transparency:** Hovering over any active node reveals its "inner monologue" (streaming tokens) in real-time.

## 🚀 The "Why"
Current chat interfaces hide the complexity of multi-agent systems. Users want to *see* the team they are working with. They want to drag a specific "Math Expert" model and plug it into a "Code Generator" model. NeuralCanvas gives them this power in a beautiful, node-based environment.
